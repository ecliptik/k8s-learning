# Kubernetes Up and Running Manifests

These are manifests from the book [Kubernetes Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043874.do).

They are almost identical to the [kubernetes-up-and-running examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-up-and-running/examples), with the exception of

- Typed in by hand (copy/paste is not the best way to learn)
- Use arm64 images instead of the default amd64 images (because learning on a RPI cluster is much more fun)
